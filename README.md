# Project 2: Test a Perceptual Phenomenon 
## Background information
In a Stroop task, participants are presented with a list of words, with each word displayed in a color of ink. The participant’s task is to say out loud the color of the ink in which the word is printed. The task has two conditions: a congruent words condition, and an incongruent words condition. In the congruent words condition, the words being displayed are color words whose names match the colors in which they are printed: for example RED, BLUE. In the incongruent words condition, the words displayed are color words whose names do not match the colors in which they are printed: for example PURPLE, ORANGE. In each case, we measure the time it takes to name the ink colors in equally-sized lists. Each participant will go through and record a time from each condition.

## Questions for investigation

## 1. What is our independent variable? What is our dependent variable? 
 
Dependent variable: Time to name ink colours

Independent variable: Word Condition (congruent/incongruent)


## 2. What is an appropriate set of hypotheses for this task? What kind of statistical test do you expect to perform? Justify your choices.

#### Hypothesis test
Null Hypthesis H0: Time to name colours is the same for congruent and incongruent tasks

Alternative Hypothesis HA: Time to name colours is not the same for congruent and incongruent tasks
